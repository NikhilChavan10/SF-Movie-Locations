SF Performances/Movies
SF open data provides a large data of Film Locations in San Francisco. This open data has number of movies with their film locations in the bay area along with more details about the film such as Production company, Writer, Director and Actors in the film. So there is a need of an application to display all the locations of the movie on the map when provided with movie name. 'Search Movie Locations' application handles this request.
This application allows a user to search on a map where movies have been filmed in the San Francisco Bay Area. The user can search any movie (available on the database) using the search input box, which suggests maximum of 10 movie name suggestions to user as soon as the user types, in the text field. Now, if the user select a movie and clicks on the Search button, the view will display all the locations of that movie shot in San Francisco Bay Area. These locations will be displayed with the help of the markers, clicking on which user can read the address. User can select and search any other movie and the view will be altered according to the locations of the movie. 
This is a full stack application with HTML,CSS,BootStrap and JavaScript used on the front end and php and MySQL on the backend. MySQL is used as the database because of the amount of data provided (more than 1000 rows) and it will be easy to scale in the future with more addition of movies in the database possible.
Extra Features possible -
Because of the time contraints, only search with movie name was provided. But we can view the locations of the movies shot by various other parameters. We can view all the movie locations by providing a particular actors or by providing directors name, or by providing productions companies name. The results will be interesting as it will provide a particular pattern for a particular director or production company and also locate which areas and locations are generally preferred by those individuals.
When user enters a movie name and its locations are displayed on the map, we can find a optimal shortest path for a user to visit all the locations.
